# Car Dataset Analysis Project Summary:

Project Overview: The project aims to analyze a dataset containing information about cars, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and data manipulation tasks using Python and Pandas library.

Data Cleaning: Identified and handled missing values: Checked for null values in the dataset and filled them with the mean value of the respective column, ensuring data completeness and accuracy.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzed different types of car makes: Utilized value counts to determine the various types of car makes present in the dataset and their respective occurrences, providing insights into the distribution of car brands.

Filtered records by origin: Filtered the dataset to display only records where the origin is either Asia or Europe, narrowing down the dataset for further analysis based on geographical origin.

Data Manipulation: Removed unwanted records based on weight: Removed records with weights above 4000, reducing the dataset to focus on cars with specific weight criteria.

Applied function on a column: Increased all the values in the 'MPG_City' column by 3, transforming the data to adjust for city fuel efficiency.

Conclusion: The project successfully cleaned, explored, and manipulated the car dataset, providing valuable insights into the distribution of car makes, filtering based on origin, and modifying data based on specified criteria. These tasks contribute to a better understanding of the dataset and support further analysis and decision-making processes.
